### Summary

I have been living in the UK since September 2022. I've been struggling quite a bit after moving (got COVID and all), but it seems like my situation is finally somewhat stabilizing.

Living by myself in a country I haven't been in for longer than 2 months is certainly really intimidating though.

### What I’m reading

- [The Emperor and I](https://www.viz.com/the-emperor-and-i)

### What I’m making

Not that much right now. I need to get a proper development machine.

### What I want to make

There's a game I want to make together with my girlfriend that's kinda inspired by Boku No Natsuyasumi and the Like a Dragon series.

I have wanted to also write some scripts for some YouTube videos since there's like, a lot I wanna talk about in regards to tech I have and have messed with. I feel like a lot of people would enjoy a video on using the Steam Deck as the main PC (which I have, ever since I moved to the UK).

### What I’m enjoying

- my girlfriend, Melanie.
- the new Haken singles. [The Alphabet of Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQJ-e75ZSj8) is a fun song.
