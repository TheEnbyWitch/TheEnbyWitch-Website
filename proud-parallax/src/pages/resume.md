## Experience

### Freelance (2018-Present) - Web Developer

I've created a website for a dental hygienist using Astro and React (more in 'Other Projects'). I've also helped build several websites for a hair care e-commerce business using WordPress, Grav CMS, and PrestaShop.

### Splash Damage (2022-2023) - Animation Programmer

I worked on the animation side of the player character on Project Astrid. My work involved working on the Control Rig and Animation Blueprints related to the Player Character to create a "True First Person" experience, while making it feel seamless and comfortable.

### Reikon Games (2019-2022) - First Person Animator

I used to work on first person animations for Final Form. My work involved creating the animations in Maya, implementing them in-game and working with the Animation Blueprints. I have also done some animation work for enemies.

### Bossa Studios (2019) - Intern Programmer

I have done some C# Programming and machine learning-related stuff in Unity to do real-time facial animations based on the webcam stream using dlib, with networking support. I have also created a tool to help build a database for training a model in C++.

## Other Projects

### Website for Topstomatologia

I designed a professional website for Topstomatologia, a dental hygienist. The site was developed utilizing Astro and React, and deployed using Netlify.

Available at https://topstomatologia.pl

### Accumulation-based Motion Blur plugin for Unreal Engine

I developed an Unreal Engine plugin designed to emulate the distinctive motion blur effect found in popular games such as Metal Gear Solid, Call of Duty, and Yakuza.
